# Harvesting From MST Services #

In case you wish to harvest from the MST's services, or inform Drupal where to harvest from, go to the 'List Services' page:

```
http://<your-mst-address>:8080/MetadataServicesToolkit/st/listServices.action
```

There you can see the repository url for each service.

_The picture below shows how 'Associated Repository URL' gets displayed when you 'List Services'._
