**The proposed changes of deleting entire pages is not going to take place.  I suggested this because I wasn't sure if any of those logs had valuable information in them.  Instead, we will make sure that valuable information is put into those logs.  This is further documented in fogbugz issue # 471**

## General Logs ##
  * **Summary:** These logs are a sort of history of when certain things are added/removed.
  * **Proposal:** remove this screen entirely.  I'm not sure what the purpose of this was, so someone else can argue for it's existence.

## HarvestIn Logs ##
  * **Summary:** There is a separate row (and corresponding log) for each external repository.
  * **Proposal:** Remove the columns that are "x"ed out.  The first 2 columns are links (neither of which actually work).
    * **Add Columns**
      * Total Active Records
      * Total Held Records
      * Total Deleted Records

## HarvestOut Logs ##
  * **Summary:** I'm guessing this is supposed to track outgoing harvests.  I'm pretty sure this doesn't currently work (if it ever did).
  * **Proposal:** remove this screen entirely.  Tracking would be a nice feature, but we have enough other bugs to fix and nice-to-have features.

## Services Logs ##
  * **Summary:** There is a separate row (and corresponding log) for each service.
  * **Proposal:** Remove the columns that are "x"ed out.
    * **Add Columns**
      * Total Active Records
      * Total Held Records
      * Total Deleted Records
