# Introduction to Normalization Service #

The eXtensible Catalog’s MARCXML Normalization Service cleans up MARCXML records by fixing common problems and inconsistencies. The service also prepares MARCXML metadata for use in a faceted-browse interface by replacing coded data with vocabulary terms and parsing this data into locally-defined 9XX fields for easy access. It is run as a series of “Normalization Steps” which can be enabled or disabled using the Normalization Service’s configuration files. This document contains information on how to configure the Normalization Service and what action is taken by each Normalization Step. The description of each normalization step also contains a brief rationale for why the step is needed to prepare MARCXML metadata for use in a user interface that incorporates faceted browsing.

Currently, this service contains steps to normalize data in either MARCXML Bibliographic or Holdings records. The service looks at the Leader 06 in MARCXML record to determine the type of record (Bibliographic or Holdings) and then applies the steps appropriate to that type of record. MARCXML record types other than Bibliographic and Holdings are passed through the services with no changes. However, additional steps could be added easily to this service so that it would also normalize records from other types of MARC records, e.g. Authority records, if desired.
